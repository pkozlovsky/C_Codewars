/*
Write the following function:

double area_of_polygon_inside_circle(double circle_radius, int number_of_sides);
It should calculate the area of a regular polygon of numberOfSides, number-of-sides, or number_of_sides sides inside a circle of radius circleRadius, circle-radius, or circle_radius which passes through all the vertices of the polygon (such circle is called circumscribed circle or circumcircle). The answer should be a number rounded to 3 decimal places.

Input :: Output Examples

area_of_polygon_inside_circle(3, 3); // => 11.691

area_of_polygon_inside_circle(5.8, 7); // => 92.053

area_of_polygon_inside_circle(4, 5); // => 38.042
